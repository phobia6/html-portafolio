<h1>The best movies according to TGP.</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p> 
    This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can make more sense after 
    watching it more than once, and how after each viewing it gets better and better. 
    Donnie Darko can be watched in 2 ways: 1.- Watch it once and enjoy it as a 
    scince fiction movie and be left with a lot of questions. Or 2.- Watch it more 
    than once and research the meaning of each symbolism, look up what this movie was 
    based on, and even try to understand some theories about time and space, and 
    then watch it again, you will be blown away.

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>
    Watching Jhon Wick makes you love movies in general, this movie reminds you
    of the best times in hollywood. By far is the best action movie of all time,
    introduces a new antihero with a story that anyone could empithysed with. 
    I've lost count of how many times I've seen it and will continue to see it.

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
    Fight Club is a piece of philosophy captured on a screen, this movie is a 
    reminder to all men of the purpose of life and freedom, a reminder of 
    how human instinct and nature are all you need to feel accomplished. 
    The catharsis that the main character goes through is a phase in life to 
    which all men must go, to trasend to a better man.
